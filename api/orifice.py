Orifice API - Simulation/Mock Implementation

This is a MOCK implementation of the Orifice API for development and testing purposes.

In a production environment:
- The actual Orifice hardware device would be used instead of the slider simulator
- The device's physical sensor would provide real depth/penetration measurements
- All socket/simulator code would be replaced with calls to the device's native API

This implementation provides:
1. A fallback simulator UI when no joystick is found (for development without hardware)
2. A consistent API interface that works the same in both mock and real environments

Usage:
    device = orifice.Orifice()
    depth = device.depth  # 0-1024 range
    # Remember to call device.close() when done
